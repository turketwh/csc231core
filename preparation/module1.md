# CSC 231: Preparation Guide For Module 1

## Read And Watch
Read the following chapters of the *Course Reader* linked from *Course Administration* module of the course Canvas site. 

**By Friday, August 29, 2025:**

* Chapter 1: Syntactic Structures
* Chapter 2: Finite State Machines
* Chapter 3: Finite State Machines: Actvities Introduction

The major points to focus on in this part of the reading are:

* Fundamental definitions relating to finite state machines (such as, but not limited to, *states*, *transitions*, *start states*, *accepting states*, *languages*, ...)
* The notion of *tracing* as a machine consumes symbols from the input
* What *acceptance* of a word means


**By Wednesday, September 3, 2025:**

* Chapter 4: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machines
* Chapter 5: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machines: Activities Introduction

The major points to focus on in this part of the reading are:

* What makes a finite state machine *non-deterministic*
* How *tracing* a word through a non-deterministic finite state machine can involve *multiple paths*
* What *acceptance* of a word means in a non-deterministic finite state machine

There may be a few videos linked in the reading that should be watched.  These will be annotated in a special callouts in the reading, each labeled as *Video Resource*.

## Questions And Clarification
If you have questions you would like to ask about the material in the reading, submit them though the *Questions And Clarification* Google form linked from *Module 1* in the course Canvas site.
