# CSC 231: Preparation Guide For Module 3

## Read And Watch
Read the following chapter(s) of the *Course Reader* linked from Module 0 of the course Canvas site. 
* Chapter 6: Regular Expressions

This is about $7$ pages of reading. Note that there may be a few videos linked in the reading that should be watched. These will be annotated in special callouts in the reading, each labeled as *Video Resource*.

The major points to focus on in the reading are:
* The conceptual difference between a *generator* for a language and a *recognizer* for a language
* How *regular expressions* represent operations on sets of words
	* Which regular expression symbols represent which operations
	* The idea of the *concatenation* operation
	* At a very high level, the idea of the *closure* operation
	* The fact that, like other mathematics operators we are familiar with, there is an *order of operations* for the regular expression operations

## Assess (Optional)
After completing the work indicated above, answer the questions in the *Module 3 Preparation Assessment* in the course Canvas site by the deadline indicated in Canvas. Remember this is optional but encouraged. You will receive feedback on this if submitted. Note that most, though not necessarily all, of the questions will be from the *Check your understanding* sections at the end of each chapter of the *Course Reader*.
