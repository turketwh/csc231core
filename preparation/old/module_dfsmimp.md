# CSC 231: Preparation Guide For Module 3
## Read And Watch
Read the following chapters of the *Course Reader* linked from Module 0 of the course Canvas site. 
* Chapter 5: DFSM Implementations

This is about $7$ pages of reading. Note that there may be a few videos linked in the reading that should be watched. These will be annotated in special callouts in the reading, each labeled as *Video Resource*.

The major points to focus on in the reading are:
* How an `if-else` implementation realizes the abstract ideas of a DFSM, in particular mapping a (current state, input symbol) pair to a new state.
* How a `tabular` implementation realizes the abstract ideas of a DFSM, in particular mapping a (current state, input symbol) pair to a new state.
* The amount of work and space in memory required to use the styles of implementations.
## Assess
After completing the work indicated above, answer the questions in the *Preparation Quiz For Module 3* in the course Canvas site by the deadline indicated in Canvas. Note that most, though not necessarily all, of the questions will be from the *Check your understanding* sections at the end of each chapter of the *Course Reader*.
