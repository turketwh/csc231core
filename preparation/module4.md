## Read
Read the PDF linked below. You can also find the PDF linked from the *Preparation* section of *Module 4* in the course Canvas site. Note it is **not** in the Course Reader.
* [String Pattern Matching Problem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nBY57YDnHHCUiYmJoG3x25EF4IzGKKgD/view?usp=drive_link)

This is about $6$ pages of reading.

The major points to focus on in the reading are:
* The definition of the *string pattern matching* problem.
  * Think about how the *string pattern matching* problem is different from the *accept only words with a property* problem
* How *algorithmic approach 1* compares parts of the pattern starting at each index in the text
* How *algorithmic approach 2* "feeds" the text into a finite state machine constructed from the pattern
* What it means to enter the *accepting* state of the pattern matching finite state machine

## Assess (Optional)
After completing the work indicated above, answer the questions in the *Module 4 Preparation Assessment* in the course Canvas site by the deadline indicated in Canvas. Remember this is optional but encouraged. You will receive feedback on this if submitted.
