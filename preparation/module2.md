# CSC 231: Preparation Guide For Module 2

## Read And Watch
Read the following chapters of the *Course Reader* linked from Module 0 of the course Canvas site. 
* Chapter 3: Designing Finite State Machines
* Chapter 4: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machines
	* **Just Sections 4.1 through 4.3**; we will not cover 4.4

This is about $10$ pages of reading.

The major points to focus on in the reading are:
* Chapter 3
	* The purpose of the three key "design" components of finite state machines: *linear ordering of transitions*, *looping*, and *branching*
* Chapter 4
	* What makes a finite state machine *non-deterministic*
	* How *tracing* a word through a non-deterministic finite state machine can involve *multiple paths*
	* What *acceptance* of a word means in a non-deterministic finite state machine

## Assess
After completing the work indicated above, answer the questions in the *Preparation Quiz For Module 2* in the course Canvas site by the deadline indicated in Canvas. Note that most, though not necessarily all, of the questions will be from the *Check your understanding* sections at the end of each chapter of the *Course Reader*.
