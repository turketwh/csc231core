# CSC 231: Preparation Guide For Module 6

## Read
Read Chapter 11 (chapter name: _Racket Lists_) of the Course Reader linked from Module 0 in the course Canvas site.

This is a little over $4$ pages of reading.

The major points to focus on in the reading are:
* How lists are written in Racket
* The general purpose of the seven built-in list functions presented in Section 11.2.2
* The idea of processing a list by:
  * Handling an empty list, OR
  * Dealing with a non-empty list by:
    * Processing the first element of the list
    * Recursively processing the rest of the elements as a smaller list
    * Combining the results from the two steps above

## Assess (Optional)
After completing the work indicated above, answer the questions in the *Module 6 Preparation Assessment* in the course Canvas site by the deadline indicated in Canvas. Remember this is optional but encouraged. You will receive feedback on this if submitted.
